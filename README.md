**Parkinson's Disease Prediction Model - README**

## Overview

This repository contains a machine learning model for predicting Parkinson's disease based on certain features extracted from patient data. Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurological disorder that affects motor functions, and early detection can significantly impact patient care and treatment outcomes. This prediction model aims to assist medical professionals in identifying individuals who may be at risk of developing Parkinson's disease.

## Dataset

The model is trained on a carefully curated dataset comprising various features from patients diagnosed with Parkinson's disease and healthy individuals. The dataset is divided into two subsets: the training set and the test set. The training set is used to train the model, while the test set evaluates its performance on unseen data.

Please note that the dataset used to build this model is not included in this repository due to privacy and licensing concerns. If you have a suitable dataset, you can follow the instructions below to train and evaluate the model.

## Requirements

To run the Parkinson's disease prediction model, you'll need the following dependencies:

- Python (>= 3.6)
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, for running the provided notebook)

You can install the required Python packages using `pip`:

```
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn jupyter
```

## Usage

1. **Data Preparation**: Prepare your dataset with relevant features for each individual, ensuring that the data is in a structured format (e.g., CSV, Excel). Make sure to split the dataset into features (X) and labels (y), where X contains the input features and y contains the binary labels (0 for healthy, 1 for Parkinson's disease).

2. **Data Preprocessing**: It's essential to preprocess the data before training the model. Depending on your dataset and features, you may need to handle missing values, normalize/standardize numerical features, and encode categorical variables.

3. **Model Training**: Train the prediction model using the preprocessed data. We recommend using popular classifiers such as Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, or Logistic Regression. You can experiment with different algorithms to find the best-performing model.

4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the trained model using the test dataset to assess its performance. Common evaluation metrics for binary classification include accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

5. **Interpretation and Visualization**: Analyze the model's results and explore feature importances to gain insights into which features contribute most to the predictions.

## Disclaimer

This prediction model should not be used as a standalone diagnostic tool for Parkinson's disease. It is intended to be a supportive tool for medical professionals in identifying potential risk factors. If you suspect Parkinson's disease in any individual, it is crucial to consult a qualified healthcare professional for accurate diagnosis and appropriate care.
